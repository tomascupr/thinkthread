# ThinkThread SDK Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview

The ThinkThread SDK includes several performance optimizations for the Chain-of-Recursive-Thoughts (CoRT) algorithm that can significantly reduce execution time while maintaining result quality. This guide explains these optimizations and how to configure them for your specific use case.

## Performance Optimizations

The SDK implements the following optimizations:

### Basic Optimizations

#### 1. Parallel Alternative Generation

Generates multiple alternative answers concurrently using `asyncio.gather()`, significantly reducing the time required for this step.

**Before optimization:**
```
Alternative 1 -> Alternative 2 -> Alternative 3 (Sequential)
```

**After optimization:**
```
Alternative 1 ─┐
Alternative 2 ─┼─> All complete together
Alternative 3 ─┘
```

#### 2. Parallel Evaluation Processing

Performs evaluations concurrently for both pairwise and batch evaluations, reducing the time required for the evaluation step.

#### 3. Response Caching

Implements a temperature-aware caching layer for LLM responses to avoid redundant API calls with identical prompts.

#### 4. Early Termination

Terminates the reasoning process early if the answers converge, saving time without compromising quality.

#### 5. Prompt Optimization

Reduces token usage in prompt templates to decrease processing time and potentially reduce costs.

#### 6. Performance Monitoring

Provides instrumentation to track execution time of different operations for analysis and optimization.

### Advanced Optimizations

#### 7. Batched API Requests

Combines multiple LLM requests into batched API calls, reducing overhead and improving throughput.

**How it works:**
- Instead of making individual API calls for each prompt, the system collects multiple prompts and sends them in a single batch
- Reduces connection overhead and takes advantage of provider-specific batching capabilities
- Particularly effective when generating multiple alternatives or performing multiple evaluations

**Benefits:**
- Reduces total API call overhead
- Improves throughput by minimizing connection setup time
- More efficient use of rate limits

#### 8. Fast Similarity Calculation

Uses optimized algorithms for string similarity calculations to speed up the early termination decision process.

**How it works:**
- Implements faster similarity metrics like Jaccard similarity and length ratio
- Avoids expensive character-by-character comparisons for large text blocks
- Uses heuristics to quickly determine if two answers are similar enough

**Benefits:**
- Up to 10x faster similarity calculations for long text
- Reduces CPU usage during evaluation
- Enables more efficient early termination

#### 9. Adaptive Temperature Control

Dynamically adjusts the temperature parameter based on convergence patterns to optimize exploration vs. exploitation.

**How it works:**
- Starts with a higher temperature to encourage diverse alternatives
- Gradually reduces temperature as answers converge
- Uses an exponential decay function based on similarity between rounds
- Adapts to the specific question and response patterns

**Benefits:**
- Better balance between exploration and exploitation
- Faster convergence to optimal answers
- Reduced token usage by avoiding unnecessary exploration

#### 10. Semantic Caching

Uses embeddings to find semantically similar prompts in the cache, even when the exact wording differs.

**How it works:**
- Generates embeddings for prompts using embedding models
- Calculates cosine similarity between embeddings to find semantically similar prompts
- Returns cached responses for prompts that are semantically equivalent
- Configurable similarity threshold to control cache hit rate

**Benefits:**
- Higher cache hit rate compared to exact matching
- Handles rephrased questions and prompts
- Reduces redundant API calls for semantically equivalent queries

## Configuration Options

All optimizations can be enabled or disabled through configuration options:

### Basic Optimization Configuration

```python
from thinkthread_sdk.config import ThinkThreadConfig

config = ThinkThreadConfig(
    # Basic performance optimization flags
    parallel_alternatives=True,    # Enable parallel generation of alternatives
    parallel_evaluation=True,      # Enable parallel evaluation processing

## Performance Benchmarks

The following benchmarks show the performance improvement with different optimization configurations:

### Basic Optimizations

### Real-world Performance

Performance varies based on several factors:

- **LLM Provider**: Different providers have different response times and rate limits
- **Network Latency**: Higher latency reduces the benefit of parallelization
- **Prompt Complexity**: Longer prompts take more time to process
- **Number of Alternatives**: More alternatives benefit more from parallelization
- **Number of Rounds**: More rounds benefit more from caching and early termination
- **Response Length**: Longer responses benefit more from fast similarity calculation
- **Query Patterns**: Similar queries benefit more from semantic caching

## Memory Usage

The caching system stores responses in memory, which can increase memory usage over time. Consider the following guidelines:

- **Estimate Cache Size**: Each cached response typically requires 1-10 KB of memory
- **Monitor Memory Usage**: Use the performance monitoring system to track memory usage
- **Clear Cache Periodically**: For long-running applications, consider clearing the cache periodically

```python
# Clear the cache periodically
from thinkthread_sdk.session import ThinkThreadSession

session = ThinkThreadSession(...)
session.llm_client.clear_cache()  # Clear the cache
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High Memory Usage

**Symptoms**: Increasing memory usage over time, potential out-of-memory errors

**Solutions**:
- Disable caching for memory-constrained environments
- Clear the cache periodically
- Reduce the number of alternatives or rounds

#### Rate Limiting

**Symptoms**: API rate limit errors, increasing response times

**Solutions**:
- Reduce the concurrency limit
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Use caching to reduce the number of API calls

#### Slow Performance

**Symptoms**: Performance not improving as expected

**Solutions**:
- Check if all optimizations are enabled
- Increase the concurrency limit (if not hitting rate limits)
- Optimize prompt templates to reduce token count
- Use a faster LLM provider

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Monitoring Integration

You can access the performance monitoring data for integration with external monitoring systems:

```python
from thinkthread_sdk.monitoring import GLOBAL_MONITOR

# Run your CoRT session
session = ThinkThreadSession(...)
result = session.run("What is the meaning of life?")

# Get performance statistics
stats = GLOBAL_MONITOR.get_stats()
print(stats)

# Example output:
# {
#   "generate_initial": {"min": 0.5, "max": 1.2, "avg": 0.8, "total": 0.8, "count": 1},
#   "generate_alternative": {"min": 0.4, "max": 0.9, "avg": 0.6, "total": 1.8, "count": 3},
#   "evaluate": {"min": 0.3, "max": 0.7, "avg": 0.5, "total": 1.0, "count": 2}
# }
```

### Custom Caching Strategies

You can implement custom caching strategies by extending the LLMClient class:

```python
from thinkthread_sdk.llm.base import LLMClient

class CustomCachingLLMClient(LLMClient):
    def _get_cache_key(self, prompt, **kwargs):
        # Implement custom cache key generation
        # For example, include only specific parameters
        return f"{prompt}_{kwargs.get('temperature', 0.7)}"
    
    def clear_cache(self):
        # Implement custom cache clearing logic
        self._cache.clear()
```

### Adaptive Concurrency

You can implement adaptive concurrency by monitoring response times and adjusting the concurrency limit:

```python
from thinkthread_sdk.monitoring import GLOBAL_MONITOR
from thinkthread_sdk.session import ThinkThreadSession

session = ThinkThreadSession(...)

# Run initial session
result = session.run("What is the meaning of life?")

# Get performance statistics
stats = GLOBAL_MONITOR.get_stats()
avg_response_time = stats.get("generate_alternative", {}).get("avg", 0.5)

# Adjust concurrency limit based on response time
if avg_response_time < 0.3:
    # Fast responses, increase concurrency
    session.llm_client.set_concurrency_limit(10)
elif avg_response_time > 1.0:
    # Slow responses, decrease concurrency
    session.llm_client.set_concurrency_limit(3)
```

## Conclusion

The performance optimizations in the ThinkThread SDK can significantly reduce the time required for Chain-of-Recursive-Thoughts (CoRT) reasoning while maintaining result quality. By configuring these optimizations appropriately for your specific use case, you can achieve a 3-5x performance improvement over the baseline implementation.
